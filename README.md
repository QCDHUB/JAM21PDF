## Abstract

We report the results of a Monte Carlo global QCD analysis of unpolarized parton distribution functions (PDFs), including for the first time constraints from ratios of $^3$He to $^3$H structure functions recently obtained by the \mar experiment at Jefferson Lab.
Our simultaneous analysis of nucleon PDFs and nuclear effects in $A\!=\!2$ and $A\!=\!3$ nuclei reveals the first indication for an isovector nuclear EMC effect in light nuclei.
We find that while the \mar data yield relatively weak constraints on the $F_2^n/F_2^p$ neutron to proton structure function ratio and on the $d/u$ PDF ratio, they suggest an enhanced nuclear effect on the $d$-quark PDF in the bound proton, questioning the assumptions commonly made in nuclear PDF analyses.
