## Abstract

We present a new global analysis of spin-averaged parton distribution functions (PDFs) including all the world data on inclusive deep inelastic scattering (DIS) measurements from Jefferson Lab energies up to HERA kinematics using the JAM MC framework. The analysis includes for the first time W/Z production in hadron-hadron collisions from the LHC providing new constraints on PDFs at high-x.  We explore the complex correlations in DIS between the extracted PDFs with  target mass corrections, higher twist effects as well as nuclear corrections for deuterium targets, providing new insights on bounded nucleons within nuclei. The analysis provides state-of-the-art collinear PDFs suitable for further exploration of nucleon structure in SIDIS programs at the Jefferson Lab 12 GeV and the future Electron Ion Collider.
